BURST CODE INTEGRATION:
To integrate the burst detection code, you need R with some pretty specific packages,
and rpy2 (2.9.5). On my machine, it took some work to get rpy2 to function properly
with R.
1) Download R and Rstudio using anaconda. DO NOT INSTALL ANY R PACKAGES YET
2) Download rpy2 using anaconda (https://anaconda.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023857134-Setting-up-rpy2-on-Windows)

3) In python, run:

>>> import rpy2.rinterface
>>> from rpy2.robjects.packages import importr
>>> base = importr('base')
>>> print(base._libPaths())

    Only one path should show up, note it. I will refer to this path as PATH

4) Open Rstudio as an administrator and run the commands in r_admin_setup_instructions.
    The first command is .libPaths(). That should return multiple paths, including PATH.
    If PATH isn't there, panic (but I'm fairly certain it will always be there).
    Assuming PATH is there, now run the command .libPaths(PATH). That will set the
    package installation library to the same library that python is looking in, allowing
    you to install the packages needed in R to run the burst detection algorithms.
